 GATHERING_STORM_NAME: "The Russian Republic"
 GATHERING_STORM_DESC: "Less than a month ago the revolutionaries forced Tsar Nikolay II to abdicate. In the old autocracy's place a new republic was established.\nFuture looks promising for the new Russia, but there are still many problems along the way, like the internal power struggle, and the fact Russia is still at war."

 BLITZKRIEG_NAME: "Red October"
 BLITZKRIEG_DESC: "1917 has become a tumultuous year for Russia. Following repeated blunders by the Provisional Government, circumstances have forced them to get help from the unruly Petrograd Soviet, who have used this opportunity to its fullest, overthrowing the republican government, helpless against the Bolshevik might.\n\nThe communists have taken power in Petrograd. This, however, sparked such an outrage that many different people have united against the Revolution."
 #“To Citizens of Russia.\n   The Provisional Government is deposed. The state power is transferred into the hands of the Military Revolutionary Committee, an organ of the Petrograd Soviet of Workers' and Soldiers' Deputies, which heads the Petrograd proletariat and garrison.\n   (...) Long live the revolution of workers, soldiers and peasants!”
 RUS_BLITZKRIEG_DESC: "The Provisional Government has become so weak, even the communists managed to take power in our capital of Petrograd. Communists, Bozhe upasi!\n\nThis WON'T do. We MUST destroy this revolution before it becomes worse."
 SOV_BLITZKRIEG_DESC: "The revolution is a success! The bourgeois Provisional Government was weak and indecisive, driving the country into ruin with its handling of both internal and foreign policy.\nNow, however, we have another problem: an Anti-Soviet united front has risen up against our rule. We must destroy them while we can."
