 GATHERING_STORM_NAME: "The Russian Republic"
 GATHERING_STORM_DESC: "Less than a month ago the revolutionaries forced Tsar Nikolay II to abdicate. In the old autocracy's place a new republic was established.\nFuture looks promising for the new Russia, but there are still many problems along the way, like the internal power struggle, and the fact Russia is still at war."

 BLITZKRIEG_NAME: "Red October"
 BLITZKRIEG_DESC: "1917 has become a restless year for Russia. After repeated failures of the Provisional Government to secure power and giving too much power to the unruly Petrograd Soviet, the latter have organized a coup against the government, helpless against the Bolshevik might.\n\nThe communists have taken power in Petrograd. This, however, angered many people so much they have united against the revolutionaries."
 #“To Citizens of Russia.\n   The Provisional Government is deposed. The state power is transferred into the hands of the Military Revolutionary Committee, an organ of the Petrograd Soviet of Workers' and Soldiers' Deputies, which heads the Petrograd proletariat and garrison.\n   (...) Long live the revolution of workers, soldiers and peasants!”
 RUS_BLITZKRIEG_DESC: "The Provisional Government has become so weak, even the communists managed to take power in our capital of Petrograd. Communists, Bozhe upasi!\n\nThis WON'T do. We MUST destroy this revolution before it becomes worse."
 SOV_BLITZKRIEG_DESC: "The revolution is a success! The bourgeois Provisional Government was weak and indecisive, driving the country into ruin with its handling of both internal and foreign policy.\nNow, however, we have another problem: an Anti-Soviet united front has risen up against our rule. We must destroy them while we can."
