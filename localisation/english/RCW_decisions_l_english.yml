However, the Soviet demanded representation in the government in exchange. Having no other choice, we had to accept. Ever since then, the Soviet has been trying to destabilize our administration and woo our supporters to their side.\nThis creates a very dangerous situation. If the Soviets get enough power, they will swiftly overthrow the Provisional Government."
